    "## Programming language of the year? Python is standout in latest rankings\n",
    "*Python* is one of the top three most popular programming languages. *Python* was created in 1989 by Dutch programmer *Guido van Rossum*. \n",
    "The Tiobe index and other popularity rankings from IEEE Spectrum and PYPL offer programmers a way to assess which languages are worth investing time into.*Python* entered TiobeÂ´s popularity index in September. \"It's often the first language taught at universities and it's the go-to language for statistical analysis, machine learning, scripting, web programming, and scientific computing\", Tiobe commented. \n",
    "It is also important to note that *Python* is the most popular language with hackers, because of its easy-to-grasp syntax, extense availability of online tutorials, and an abundance of harmless third-party software libraries that can be repurposed for malicious use.\n"
